Data::Handle

This Package serves as a very *very* simple interface to a packages
__DATA__ section.

Its primary purposes is to make successive accesses viable without
needing to scan the file manually for the __DATA__ marker.

It does this mostly by recording the current position of the file handle
on the first call to "->new", and then re-using that position on every
successive "->new" call, which eliminates a bit of the logic for you.

At present, it only does a simple heuristic ( backtracking ) to verify
the current position is immediately at the start of a __DATA__ section,
but we may improve on this one day.
