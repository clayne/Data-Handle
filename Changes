Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
          Reworked the Exception code to be cleaner at the cost of a slight
          initialisatin cost.

          Reworked code bodies to unify seek/tell calls as _restore_pos and _set_pos.

          Added _fh so internal code is less confusing.

          Extended tests to cover more scenarios.

          Added contributed suggestions as "alternative_techinques" with demonstrations how they
          *( so far ) don't work. If people can get them to work (on all perls), that'd be great!.
          ( Seems there are many weird fdup bugs in perl )
